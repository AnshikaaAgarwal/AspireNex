# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for a very small percentage of 0.17%. To address this imbalance, oversampling using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed. Various classification models including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) were implemented to build and evaluate the detection system.

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing a small fraction of all transactions.
